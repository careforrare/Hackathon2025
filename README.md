## Synthetic Graph
The biological background part of the graph (neo4j version 5.25.1) can be downloaded from [LRZ Sync&Share](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiUyxWQz72XE4ttzusb9qn/biological_background.dump).

The `SYNTETIC_singleScript.cypher`file produces synthetic patient data with the same connection and attribute types as the real patient data.

## About the Graph
It is a highly modified version of the [clinical knowledge graph](https://ckg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and has not been published yet.
As it contains proprietary ontologies such as SNOMED-CT, the graph is explicitly __NOT OPEN SOURCE__.

The documentation for the graph can be found in `graph_README.md`. 

## Contact
Should you have any questions, contact [Henrik Otterstedt](mailto:Henrik.Otterstedt@med.uni-muenchen.de) or open an issue.
